		=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=


	express-validator is a set of express.js middlewares that wraps the extensive collection 
	of validators and sanitizers offered by validator.js.

	It allows you to combine them in many ways so that you can validate and sanitize your 
	express requests, and offers tools to determine if the request is valid or not, which 
	data was matched according to your validators, and so on.


  Installation: npm i express-validator
  

  Setup in your Application
=============================

	import express from 'express'
	import {_________} from 'express-validator'


Form Validation using express-validator
=======================================
 
 import {check, validationResult} from 'express-validator'

 check middleware
==================

  check(fields:string, message)

 fields:- 	One or more field names to select. If omitted, selects the whole request location.
 message:-	Which error message to use when a validator doesn't specify one.
 
Example:
-------

 user is submitting form on /verify route, which submits email field, which needs to be verified 
 whether it's a correct form of email or not.

 app.post("/verify", [
     check("email", "Email is not valid").isEmail()
 ], (req, res)=>{
     const result = validationResult
	 if(result.isEmpty())
		res.send("valid email")
	 else
	    res.send(result)
 })


 The check middleware will check for the field(email) if it's email then proceeds the request
 if not then error message is being pushed to validationResult object. which we can use to 
 handle the request.
